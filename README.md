# PlexExportCSV
 This script will connect to your personal Plex Media server and export metadata from your library to a CSV file.

# Usage:
create/edit the plexExportCSV_config.py file to include your own Plex IP and Token.


You can find your Token by browsing your media as you normally would, view the XML for any movie and examining the URL returned.

At the end you will see a "X-Plex-Token=" --- Enter only the token as you see it.
